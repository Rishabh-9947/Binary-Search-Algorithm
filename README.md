# Binary-Search-Algorithm
This project involves implementing the binary search algorithm in Python. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.
# Binary Search Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the Binary Search Algorithm in Python. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and comparing the target value to the middle element of the array.

## Features

- Efficient searching in sorted arrays.
- Returns the index of the target value if found.
- Provides a clear example of a divide-and-conquer algorithm.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you will need Python installed on your system. No additional libraries are required.

## Usage

To perform a binary search, you will need a sorted array and a target value. The script will return the index of the target value within the array.

```python
sorted_array = [1]
target_value = 5
index = binary_search(sorted_array, target_value)

Implementation Details
The binary search function implemented in this repository uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the search interval in half. The function checks if the middle element is the target value. If not, it determines whether to continue the search to the left or right of the middle element.
Contributing
Contributions to improve the algorithm or to extend its functionality are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
